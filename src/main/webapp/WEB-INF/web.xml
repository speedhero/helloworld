  <!-- Servlet Filters ================================================ -->

  <!--
    - Declare a filter for multipart MIME handling
    -->

    <filter-name>struts2</filter-name>
    <filter-class>org.apache.struts2.dispatcher.ng.filter.StrutsPrepareAndExecuteFilter</filter-class>

  <!-- The Struts 2 filter should be mapped to ALL requests coming into the web application.  As a filter,
                it can let the non-struts requests pass through and they will arrive at which ever servlets to which
                they may be mapped.  Of course, this sample app has no other servlets, so we expect the filter to catch
                everything.  When the filter recognizes a Struts 2 request, typically by the .action extension, the
                normal filter chaining of a web application is aborted and the request is completely handled by
                the Struts 2 system. -->
